### (Fancy Title in progress) 

#### Shows my work over the 2nd half of Summer 2023 on de-noising the PPMI metric. 

**Note** 

- still need to do some house keeping, but i figured it's best to show the work i've done, regardless of how much room for improvement there is.
- Please see the Final_Report.pdf for more information on the actual goals, data, and processes.
